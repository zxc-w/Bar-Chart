# Bar Chart Visualization

Project #1 of the Data Visualization using D3 library certification on freeCodeCamp.

## What I Learned

- The `timeScale()` method in D3 to create the `xScale` function for mapping time values on the horizontal axis.

- The `d3.timeParse()` method to parse a date string into a `Date` object.

- The `d3.timeFormat()` method to format a `Date` object into a specific string format.

- Improved my understanding of the `domain()` and `range()` methods for the scales. At first, I thought the range was the value of the y-axis for the horizontal axis or the value of the x-axis for the vertical axis. In fact, the range defines the output values of the raw data, where they should be placed within the available width or height of the `svg`.

- Learned to use the `.on()` event handler in D3 and the `.html()` method to insert HTML code into a selected element.
