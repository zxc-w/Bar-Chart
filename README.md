# Bar Chart Visualization

Project #1 of the Data Visualization using D3 library Certification on freeCodeCamp.

## What I learned

- The `timeScale()` method in D3 to create the `xScale` function for time on the horizontal axis.

- The `d3.parseDate()` method to parse date objects into a specific string format.

- Improved my understanding of the `domain()` and `range()` methods for the scales. At first, I thought the range was the value of the y-axis for the horizontal axis or the value of the x-axis for the vertical axis. In fact, the range defines the output values of the raw data, where they should be placed within the available width or height of the `svg`.

- Learned to use the `.on()` event handler in D3 and the `.html()` method to insert HTML code into a selected element.
