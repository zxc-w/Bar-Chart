# Bar Chart Visualization

Project #1 of the Data Visualization using D3 library Certification on freeCodeCamp.

## What I learned

- The `timeScale()` in D3 to create `xScale` function for time on the horizontal axis.

- The `d3.parseDate()` method to parse the data object into a specific string format.

- Improved my understanding of the `domain()` and `range()` methods on the scales, where I first thought that the range is the value of y axis for the horizontal axis or the value of x axis for the vertical axis. The range actually was the output value of the raw datum to where it should be on the available width of `svg`.

- Leanred the `.on()` event handler on D3 and `.html()` to insert HTML code into a selected element.
